Each sorting method is expecting to take in an array, sort, and return the array sorted. 

1. Bubble-sort:
  Big-O Time: Ðž(n2)
  * The only significant advantage that bubble sort has over most other algorithms,but not insertion sort, is that the ability to detect that the list is sorted efficiently is built into the algorithm. When the list is already sorted (best-case), the complexity of bubble sort is only O(n).
  Big-O Space: O(1) 

2. Insertion-sort:
  Big-O Time: O(n2) or O(n) in the best-case, already sorted list. 
  Big-O Space: O(1)

3. Selection-sort:
  Big-O Time: O(n2)
  Big-O Space: O(1)
